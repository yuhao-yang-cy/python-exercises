These are some of the short programs I wrote when I was learning python from an online open course provided on Coursera in 2014. This course has now become a part of the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization. For latest course details, please see:

I learned the basic coding skills from the earlier version of this course and was able to build a few simple interactive arcade games with python, for which I enjoyed quite much. Each of the separate .py file works on its own.
